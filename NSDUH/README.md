# A skeptic's guide to statistics in the media

This repository contains code files for the blog post on
[The SAS Dummy blog](https://blogs.sas.com/content/sasdummy/2019/08/19/media-data-literacy/).

The code collects data from the published surveys at [SAMHSA.gov](https://samhsa.gov/data/),
in particular the [National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/nsduh-national-survey-drug-use-and-health).
