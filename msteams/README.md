# Publish to Microsoft Teams with SAS

This repository contains code files for the blog post on
[The SAS Dummy blog](https://blogs.sas.com/content/sasdummy/sas-microsoft-teams/).

To provide a rich, integrated experience with Microsoft Teams, you can publish content using a webhook. A webhook is a REST API endpoint that allows you to post messages and notifications with more control over the appearance and interactive options within the messages. In SAS, you can publish to a webhook by using PROC HTTP.
