# The SAS Dummy blog

This repository contains code files for many of the examples that you'll find on [The SAS Dummy blog](https://blogs.sas.com/sasdummy).

## Support
These code files are provided as examples and as such aren't officially supported by SAS.  However, I encourage you to visit the blog and ask questions in the comments.  I respond to all comments, answer questions when I can, and make corrections when readers point out mistakes.  (Yes, it happens.)
